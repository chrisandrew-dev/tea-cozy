# Tea Cozy

## Description
A simple one-page website completed to a supplied design specification. This project is part of the Web Development career path at [Codecademy.com](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog). This responsive solution is just beyond the scope of the brief, which didn't require the page to scale. 

A note for students: 
This repo doesn't include starter files or the original design brief; you can find them at Codecademy. Please attempt the project on your own before referencing this example.
